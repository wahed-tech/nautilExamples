# Running the example

To run the example, start the services defined in serviceA/serviceA.go and serviceB/serviceB.go first by running go run <file name>. You'll have to run them in separate terminals. Then in a third terminal, start the gatewayTest.go and visit http://localhost:3001 which should show you a playground to interact with.
